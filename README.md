## Research Focus

I work on **influence-aware unlearning in Offline Reinforcement Learning**.

Key directions:

- Selective trajectory removal without retraining  
- Gradient similarity analysis between retain and forget sets  
- Stability–plasticity balance in value-based RL  
- Privacy-aware imitation learning

## Selected Research

### CURe — Conservative Unlearning with Soft-Gating
Gradient similarity–based trajectory filtering for offline RL.

- Seconds-level unlearning instead of retraining
- Benchmarked against retraining, fine-tuning, random rewards, TrajDeleter
- Stable returns across MuJoCo tasks

(ICML 2026 — Submitted)

### PateGAIL++
Utility-optimized private trajectory generation using imitation learning.

- Privacy–utility trade-off evaluation
- Mobility trajectory modeling

(ICLR 2026 — Accepted)

## Systems Built

**ProdRAG**  
Persistent arXiv retrieval engine using FAISS + SentenceTransformers with incremental indexing and latency evaluation.

**NutriScan**  
Sequential multi-agent nutrition analysis system.  
React Native frontend + FastAPI backend deployed on Google Cloud Run.

**Sanskrit Voice-to-Text**  
78-hour ASR dataset. CNN–RNN + CTC training.  
WER reduced from 44% → 2%.
